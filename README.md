# C Compiler in Rust
A basic C compiler written in Rust, roughly following the tutorial [here](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj). The tutorial is in C, so there are many 
opportunities to prefer idomatic Rust over the techniques in the tutorial. To help with this, the [official Rust compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler) was taken as inspiration.

Currently, there is basic mathematical symbol parsing.
